It highlights uncommon and mispeled words as red.
Common words are light grey: the, about, find, last, copyright.
Less common words are dark grey: TCO, Lumix, substring, phenotypes, conspiracies.

Why did I make it?

I've been using Google search as a spell checker for years.

When I search for "colocual" it shows "Showing results for colloquial".
[Todo: better example]

How does it work?
It uses Google's database of 50k most common words sorted by usage frequency.
It has proper nouns (Google), slang (todo: add an example), and popular
lexemes (not just "go" but also "went", "gone", "going", etc.).

(Unfortunately, it includes commonly misspelled words such as "doesnt"
but there aren't too many of them.)

The first, most common word in that database is "the".
The 50k word is "paa" (I don't know what it means).
